# Product Requirements Document: Web Search Integration & Enhanced Conversation Features

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enhances the LINE Bot with intelligent web search capabilities and improved conversation management. The bot will automatically determine when real-time information is needed and search the web to provide current, accurate responses about news, weather, stock prices, and other time-sensitive topics. Additionally, conversation history will be extended to maintain context over longer interactions while optimizing language matching for bilingual users.

**Problem Solved:** Users currently cannot get real-time information (news, weather, stock prices) and conversations lose context too quickly with only 20 messages of history.

**Goal:** Enable intelligent web search for real-time information and extend conversation memory to 100 messages while ensuring responses match the user's language preference.

## Goals

1. **Real-time Information Access:** Enable users to get current information on news, weather, stock prices, and other time-sensitive topics
2. **Intelligent Search Decision:** AI automatically determines when web search is needed without user intervention
3. **Enhanced Conversation Memory:** Extend conversation history from 20 to 100 messages for better context retention
4. **Seamless Language Matching:** Ensure responses consistently match the language of the user's input
5. **Safe and Reliable Search:** Implement content filtering, rate limiting, and caching for optimal performance

## User Stories

1. **As a LINE Bot user**, I want to ask "What's the latest news about Thailand?" and receive current, summarized information with sources, so that I stay informed about recent events.

2. **As a financial enthusiast**, I want to ask "What's Tesla's current stock price?" and get real-time market data, so that I can make informed decisions.

3. **As a traveler**, I want to ask "What's the weather in Bangkok today?" and receive current weather conditions, so that I can plan my activities.

4. **As a Thai speaker**, I want to ask questions in Thai and receive responses in Thai, so that I can communicate naturally in my preferred language.

5. **As a frequent user**, I want the bot to remember our previous 50 exchanges (100 messages), so that I can have meaningful, contextual conversations without repeating information.

6. **As a casual user**, I want the bot to automatically know when to search the web without me having to request it explicitly, so that I get accurate information effortlessly.

## Functional Requirements

### Web Search Integration
1. The system must integrate OpenAI's built-in web search tool using the tools parameter in chat completions
2. The system must automatically determine when web search is needed based on query analysis (real-time information, current events, recent data)
3. The system must provide summarized answers that include source attribution without showing raw search results
4. The system must handle search failures gracefully with fallback to existing knowledge
5. The system must implement rate limiting of 10 searches per user per hour to prevent abuse
6. The system must filter out adult content, spam, and unreliable sources from search results
7. The system must cache search results for 15 minutes to avoid redundant queries for similar requests

### Conversation History Enhancement
8. The system must increase conversation history limit from 20 to 100 messages (50 user + 50 assistant messages)
9. The system must optimize token usage to handle longer conversations within API limits
10. The system must maintain conversation trimming when approaching maximum limits
11. The system must preserve conversation metadata including message types and timestamps

### Language Matching Optimization
12. The system must detect the language of each user message automatically
13. The system must respond in the same language as the user's current message
14. The system must handle mid-conversation language switches seamlessly
15. The system must update the system prompt to include explicit language matching instructions

### Safety and Performance
16. The system must implement content filtering to block inappropriate search results
17. The system must log search queries and results for monitoring and debugging
18. The system must provide error messages when search fails or is rate-limited
19. The system must maintain existing streaming response functionality with search integration

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Complex Search UI:** No search result ranking interface or advanced search options
- **Search History:** Not storing long-term search history or user search preferences
- **External Search APIs:** Not integrating with Google, Bing, or other third-party search services
- **Real-time Streaming of Search Results:** Search results will be processed and summarized before response
- **Multi-language Translation:** Not translating content between languages, only matching response language
- **Advanced Analytics:** Not implementing detailed search analytics or user behavior tracking
- **Conversation Export:** Not providing conversation history export functionality

## Design Considerations

- **LINE Message Limits:** Ensure search result summaries fit within LINE's message character limits (~2000 characters)
- **Response Time:** Search requests should complete within 10 seconds to maintain good user experience
- **Visual Indicators:** Consider adding subtle indicators when web search is being performed (if technically feasible)
- **Error Messaging:** Provide clear, friendly error messages in the user's language when search fails

## Technical Considerations

- **OpenAI Integration:** Use OpenAI's built-in web search tool via the `tools` parameter in chat completions API
- **Token Management:** Implement intelligent conversation trimming to balance history length with API token limits
- **Caching Strategy:** Implement Redis-like in-memory caching for search results with TTL
- **Rate Limiting:** Use user ID-based rate limiting stored in conversation service
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for search timeouts, API failures, and rate limits
- **System Prompt Updates:** Enhance existing system prompt with search usage guidelines and language matching instructions
- **Existing Architecture:** Build on current `OpenAIService` and `ConversationService` without breaking changes

## Success Metrics

1. **Search Usage:** 20% of user queries trigger web search functionality within first month
2. **Response Accuracy:** 95% of real-time information queries receive current, relevant answers
3. **Language Matching:** 99% of responses match the language of user input
4. **Conversation Engagement:** Average conversation length increases from 5 to 15 exchanges
5. **Error Rate:** Less than 5% of search requests result in errors or timeouts
6. **User Satisfaction:** No increase in support tickets related to incorrect or outdated information

## Open Questions

1. **Search Query Optimization:** Should we implement query preprocessing to improve search result relevance?
2. **Source Credibility:** How should we handle conflicting information from different sources?
3. **Search Scope:** Should we allow users to manually trigger search with specific commands (e.g., "search for...")?
4. **Conversation Migration:** How do we handle existing conversations when increasing history limits?
5. **Performance Monitoring:** What specific metrics should we track for search performance and accuracy?
6. **Fallback Behavior:** In what scenarios should the bot admit it cannot find current information vs. providing older knowledge?
