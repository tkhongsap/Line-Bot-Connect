# PRD: Image Understanding for LINE Bot

## Introduction/Overview
Add image understanding capabilities to the existing LINE Bot by leveraging GPT-4.1-nano's vision features. This will allow users to send images and ask questions about their content, extending the bot's conversational abilities beyond text-only interactions.

## Goals
1. Enable users to send images through LINE and receive intelligent responses about image content
2. Maintain the current conversational flow and bilingual support (English/Thai)
3. Implement using only GPT-4.1-nano's native vision capabilities (no additional OCR or vision models)
4. Provide seamless user experience that feels natural within existing chat interface

## User Stories
1. **As a LINE user**, I want to send a photo of a document so that I can ask questions about its content
2. **As a LINE user**, I want to send a screenshot of an error message so that I can get help troubleshooting
3. **As a LINE user**, I want to send a picture of food so that I can learn about the dish or get recipe suggestions
4. **As a LINE user**, I want to send an image with text in Thai/English so that the bot can read and respond in my preferred language

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must accept image messages (JPG, PNG, GIF formats) through LINE Bot webhook
2. The system must download and process images from LINE's content API
3. The system must integrate image data with GPT-4.1-nano's vision capabilities
4. The system must maintain conversation context when processing images (like current text messages)
5. The system must support follow-up questions about previously sent images within the same conversation
6. The system must respond in the same language as the user's accompanying text or previous conversation
7. The system must handle image processing errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
8. The system must respect LINE's message size limits and image format requirements
9. The system must log image processing events for monitoring and debugging

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. OCR preprocessing or text extraction services
2. Document format support (PDF, DOC, etc.)
3. Image generation or editing capabilities
4. Video or audio file processing
5. Advanced image manipulation or filtering
6. Integration with external vision APIs beyond GPT-4.1-nano
7. Image storage or gallery features

## Design Considerations
- Maintain consistency with current text message UI/UX flow
- Images should be processed within LINE's existing message thread
- Error messages should follow the current bilingual format
- Response time should be reasonable (under 10 seconds for typical images)

## Technical Considerations
1. Integrate with existing LineService webhook handler
2. Use LINE Bot SDK's message content API to download images
3. Extend OpenAIService to handle vision-enabled requests
4. Maintain current conversation history format with image message references
5. Ensure proper cleanup of temporary image files
6. Handle LINE's image size and format limitations
7. Implement proper error handling for network issues during image download

## Success Metrics
1. Successfully process 90%+ of supported image formats without errors
2. Reduce "I can't help with that" responses by 30% for visual content queries
3. Maintain current response time standards (under 10 seconds average)
4. Zero critical errors in image processing pipeline
5. User engagement increase measured by images sent per conversation

## Open Questions
1. Should there be a daily limit on image processing per user to manage costs?
2. Should the bot proactively describe images when sent without accompanying text?
3. How should we handle very large images that might exceed processing limits?
